# Dice_Simulator_in_Python
Created a Dice Simulator , which gives the random output just as the real Dice gives. It is known as virtual Dice.  
In this basic project learnt about different libraries and modules such "RANDOM" in Python. 
Also learnt about managing and keeping code readable and minimalist.
This project is done while studying Python for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
